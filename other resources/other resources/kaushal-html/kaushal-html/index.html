<h1> How Do Amber Teething Necklaces Work? </h1>
<img src="img/5_misconception.jpg" />
<div class="content" >
<p>Teething necklaces have been used by parents for centuries, especially in the Baltic region of Europe from which the most effective form of the resin originates. While these parents may not have known how or why these baubles helped to relieve the pain, drooling, inflammation and irritability that their children experienced as new teeth broke through the surface of the gums, they did realize that the treatment was effective. Modern parents who hope to alleviate these difficult symptoms for their own children without resorting to over-the-counter topical analgesic gels filled with synthetic chemicals are helping amber teething necklaces to enjoy a resurgence in popularity. Thanks to today's scientific advances, however, it is possible to understand exactly how and why a teething necklace made from amber can make the process of teething easier for your child.</p>
<p><strong>Amber in Medicinal History</strong><br>
Amber has been used in a variety of forms as a medicinal treatment for centuries. Amber oil, amber powder tinctures and also amber jewelry are listed in the medicine lists of many ancient societies. Today you will find amber teething necklaces in many European pharmacies today, since doctors have long been aware of their ability to bring relief to the symptoms of teething.</p>
<p><strong>Succinic Acid</strong><br>
Contrary to popular belief, amber is not a stone. It's a natural resin that has been fossilized, retaining many of its original chemical compounds. While there are a variety of imitation amber beads commercially available, only true amber contains succinic acid, an all-natural anti-inflammatory with antibiotic and pain-relieving properties. Of all the varieties of authentic amber, that which comes from the Baltic region of Europe contains the highest concentration of succinic acid, 3 &ndash; 8%. Succinic acid is a powerful antioxidant. It helps fight toxic free radicals, helps improve the immune system, and reduces stress. Succinic acid from other natural sources is also used in many different pharmaceutical and herbal medicines today.</p>
<p><strong>Direct Contact Between a Teething Necklace and Baby's Skin</strong><br>
In order for your baby to absorb the succinic acid contained within natural Baltic amber, the beads should have direct contact with his skin. The compound is absorbed through skin contact, and circulates through the body to provide a safe alternative to commercially available numbing gels. The highest content of the acid is found in the amber cortex&ndash;the external layer of the stone. For that reason, raw amber that has NOT been highly polished is recommended to achieve the highest benefit. Full skin contact provides the most effective level of succinic acid to combat teething symptoms. The necklace should be short enough that the beads don't fall over the collar of a shirt, but remains next to the skin.</p>
<p><strong>Body Heat</strong><br>
When a teething necklace made of authentic Baltic amber lies against your baby's skin, his body heat will warm the fossilized resin and allow the release of naturally-occurring succinic acid. When contact between the teething necklace and skin is maintained, succinic acid is absorbed and the healing, pain-relieving properties begin to take effect.</p>
<p><strong>Anxiety Reduction</strong><br>
When a baby is in pain, anxiety and stress are very natural and normal reactions. This anxiety often results in the irritability and crying that parents of teething babies are all too familiar with. A 2003 study by the Department of Pharmacology and Shenyang Pharmaceutical University in China showed a correlation between the introduction of succinic acid and the reduction of temperature-induced stress in laboratory mice. The same study also showed that succinic acid had a very slight sedative effect, meaning that the introduction of succinic acid into your baby's bloodstream through his teething necklace will not only relieve his physical discomfort, but that of the emotional sort as well.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that your baby's teething necklace proves to be an effective remedy for symptoms associated with teething, it's important to purchase it from a reputable dealer. Imitation beads made of glass or plastics will have no analgesic effect, nor will those crafted from the immature copal resin amber-lookalike. Purchasing authentic Baltic amber and maintaining direct contact between the necklace and your baby's skin is the best way to reap all the benefits of this safe, all-natural pain-reliving alternative.</p>

<h1> 6 Top Tips When Shopping for Amber Teething Jewelry </h1>
<img src="img/6_top_tips.jpg" />
<div class="content">
<p>When you’re shopping for amber teething jewelry, there are several key points to keep in mind. As with any product, there are differences in quality and differences in the distributors of the product. We’ve listed some helpful tips below that will help you make an informed choice when shopping for amber teething jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>1. Choose Trustworthy Distributor!</strong><br/> Amber comes in many different shades and can easily be copied by disreputable dealers. Since the tests to determine if your amber is authentic cannot be performed until after the amber is in your possession, determining that your provider is trustworthy before making a purchase is very important. Be sure to verify that the distributor that you are dealing with has a verifiable history of selling genuine amber teething jewelry before making your purchase. Check to see how long they have been in business and check for real life testimonials from people who have purchased amber teething jewelry from them. Also, check out their guarantee and return policy, shipping costs and, of course, that they provide a secure and safe payment option.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Make sure it’s Baltic Amber!</strong><br/> Just as all herbal supplements are not of equal quality, the healing properties contained in different types of amber can vary, also. Look for true Baltic amber.  True Baltic amber is tree resin that has been fossilized over millions of years. Tree resin that is only a few thousand years old is sometimes also referred to as amber, but does not contain the concentration of succinic acid that is found in Baltic amber, which ranges from 3 – 8%.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Check how the jewelry is made!</strong><br/> The safety of children who will be wearing the amber teething jewelry should always be your first concern. Amber teething necklaces should always have each individual bead knotted in place. This will prevent the beads from breaking lose from the necklace and scattering like beads would on a traditional necklace string.</p>
<p><strong>4. Shop for raw(unpolished) amber beads!</strong><br/> Understanding how the amber teething jewelry works will help you choose the most effective products. First of all, amber is not a stone. It is a fossilized resin. When the amber is worn next to the skin, the warmth from the body heat releases natural oils, which are absorbed through the skin. It is the succinic acid contained in the oils,which has the healing properties that help relieve the pain, inflammation and drooling related to teething. When the amber is in its raw state and hasn’t been polished, it will release a higher percentage of the healing succinic acid. Always check for an indication that the teething jewelry is made from RAW amber.</p>
<p><strong>5. Size is important!</strong><br/> Selecting the proper size of amber teething jewelry for the baby that is going to wear it is another important safety issue. A necklace should be big enough to make the wearing comfortable for your little ones but small enough to make it difficult for baby to put necklace in the mouth. Recommended sizing is as follows:
up to 2 years old – 12” – 12.5”
2 – 4 years old – 12.5” – 13”
4-6 years old – 13” – 13.5”<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Shop for lighter colors.</strong><br/> You’ll find that natural amber comes in many different color. Although every color of Baltic amber contains succinic acid, it is believed that the lighter colors contain a higher level of this medicinal ingredient.  Milky and lemon are considered some of the strongest amber colors. Honey and Cognac fit in the next highest level. Dark Green, Cherry and Dark Cherry would be the lowest on the scale for the Baltic amber, but still provide effective relief, even at the lower level.</p>
<p>Amber teething jewelry has been used for years in Europe to help alleviate the discomfort of teething in babies and young children. The natural soothing properties of amber are now becoming more widely known and accepted. Research the claims yourself and then seek out trusted suppliers to order your amber teething jewelry from. Your baby’s gums will find the relief they need as those new teeth are pushing through. A happy baby means happy parents!</p>

<h1> 7 Easy Tests To Identify Real Amber </h1>
<img src="img/7_easy_tests.jpg" />
<div class="content">
<p>It is unfortunate that we cannot simply trust suppliers to provide the product that they claim that they are selling, but often we can’t. When purchasing items over the Internet, buyers need to be especially wary of claims of authenticity since the images on a website provide no validation of what a product is made of. Even when you have the product in hand, unless you are very familiar with the real thing, false products can be passed off as true Baltic amber.</p>
</br>
<p>To be sure that the product you have purchased is truly Baltic amber and will contain the healing properties of succinic acid that you are seeking, you may want to test the amber beads. There are several methods used to authenticate true amber. We’ve listed them below.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Inspection</strong><br/> To distinguish real amber beads from plastic or glass beads of an amber color, look for natural imperfections. Amber may have tiny air bubbles or cracks in it. The beads also should not all be perfectly round or of the same size. Amber also will feel warm to the touch, instead of having the chill of glass.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Test</strong><br/>Amber is very lightweight and will not have the weight of a glass bead or even that of a solid plastic bead. To test this property of Baltic Amber, create saltwater by mixing together one part salt with two parts water. True amber beads should float in the saltwater, while glass or plastic beads sink.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Black Light Test</strong><br/> This test is actually kind of fun. You will need some form of ultra-violet (UV) light, commonly known as a black light. Using a UV flashlight is the easiest. If your amber beads are true Baltic Amber and not Copal, they should create a fluorescent glow from the black light. Depending on the color of your amber beads, the fluorescent glow could be anywhere from a yellow-green to a bluish hue.</p>
<p><strong>The Static Test</strong><br/>Simply rubbing the bead between two layers of soft cloth should create a static charge in the bead, similar to rubbing a balloon on your hair, if it is true Baltic amber. The static should be able to attract a light piece of paper to it. If the bead is made of lower grade Copal, the bead will not develop a static charge and may instead become sticky.</p>
<p><strong>Other Means of Testing for Real Amber Beads</strong><br/>
<p><strong>Scratch Test</strong><br/> This test can distinguish amber from colored glass. If you don’t mind the potential of damaging one of the beads by scratching it, you could try this test. Try scratching the bead with something metal. True amber is soft enough to be scratched by metal where a glass bead would not be scratched by metal.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Scent Test</strong><br/> Amber has a strong tree scent since it is formed from fossilized tree resin. The smell may sometimes be detected upon immediately opening a sealed bag of raw Baltic Amber beads, but not always. The scent test is usually performed by heating a bead. Once you’ve become familiar with the smell of amber, it is fairly easy to detect, but detecting the difference between the fresh pine scent of lesser quality Copal and the stronger scent of Baltic Amber can be a bit tricky to a newcomer. If your amber colored bead melts when heated, then you’ll probably smell a melted plastic odor instead. THIS is a definite indication of a fake!</p>
<p><strong>Acetone Test</strong><br/>When attempting to distinguish true Baltic Amber from other resins like Copal or from plastics, the acetone test is pretty accurate. A few drops of acetone on true amber will not affect or harm the bead at all, but plastics, copal or other synthetic resins will likely turn sticky from the acetone.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are several ways to test the authenticity of your amber beads, though some can be a bit destructive in the process. Should you determine that the beads are fake, you may find it difficult to get a refund on your money from a provider that has not been truthful in their representation prior to the sale. Purchasing your Baltic Amber teething jewelry from a reputable dealer with a strong, trustworthy background remains the best way to protect yourself from being taken advantage of when buying amber beads.</p>

<h1>5 Common Misconceptions About Amber Teething Necklaces </h1>
<img src="img/5_misconception.jpg" />
<div class="content">
<p>You may have heard of amber teething necklaces from others or perhaps this is your first introduction to this natural alternative for relieving the discomfort of teething in babies. Whichever is the case, it is important for you to understand the true facts about amber teething jewelry and how they work.</p>
<p><strong>1. Amber is a stone.  Incorrect!</strong><br/> Although amber is found in the ground, it is not a stone or a mineral. Amber is fossilized resin. Amber is created from the pressure of the earth as it compresses the ancient forests that were buried millions of years ago. The resin from the trees is what creates amber and gives it its unique scent and variety of color shades. Baltic Amber, that considered the world’s finest, is 35 to 40millions years old. It’s always warm to touch and possesses electrostatic properties.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Amber teething necklaces are for chewing on.  Incorrect!</strong><br/> Amber teething jewelry should be kept out of a child’s mouth. Unlike teething rings and other items that bring soothing to a teething child by chewing on them, amber teething necklaces are to be worn around the neck of the child and only when in adult supervision. Amber brings relief to inflamed gums and decreases drooling by releasing succinic acid through the child’s skin. The amber must be in contact with the child’s skin in order to be affective, but the necklace should not be long enough to be pulled into the child’s mouth.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Amber teething necklaces are a new idea. Incorrect!</strong><br/>  In Europe families have been using amber teething necklaces for so long that it has become a tradition. The Celts, Romans, Greeks and Arabs all valued the healing properties of amber. Although they may not have understood how and why the amber brought healing to their bodies, they knew that the beautifully colored amber had unseen medicinal properties.</p>
<p><strong>4. There is no scientific basis for using amber as a teething remedy. Incorrect! </strong><br/> Today, we know what ingredient in the amber has these healing properties and how it is transferred from the amber into our bodies. The ingredient which brings relief to teething babies is called succinic acid.It is transferred through the skin as the beads of the amber necklace are warmed by the body temperature of the child. Nobel prize winning scientist, Robert Koch, studied the properties of succinic acid and confirmed its positive traits. He also established its safety by determining that there was no danger of succinic acid building up within the body. Succinic acid is an FDA approved ingredient in many items you buy today.  Baltic amber has been sold for years in pharmacies throughout Europe(particularly Germany, Switzerland and Australia) as a traditional safe remedy to assist with teething.</p>
<p><strong>5. All amber has the same healing properties.  Incorrect!</strong><br/>  Fossilized resin can be found in many parts of the world, but it is only Baltic Amber, otherwise known as succinite, that contains the higher levels of succinic acid required for effective relief for teething symptoms. Different colors of the Baltic Amber are also said to have higher levels of succinic acid than others. Generally, it is the lighter colors of Baltic Amber that are preferred for use in amber teething necklaces.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p>In summary, amber teething necklaces have been used to bring relief to teething babies for centuries. Because the majority of amber in the world is found in the European region, Baltic Amber, that is where the practice originated. Baltic Amber is a fossilized resin that releases succinic acid into a child’s body when kept in contact with their warm skin. It is this safe and natural ingredient that brings relief for their teething symptoms. When shopping for amber teething necklaces, be sure to look for true Baltic Amber from a trusted source; an imitation amber teething necklace will certainly disappoint.</p>

<h1> 6 Best Practices for Safe Amber Teething Jewelry Usage </h1>
<img src="img/6_best_prectices.jpg" />
<div class="content">
<p>The drooling, pain and frustration of teething can be a test for babies, as well as the parents and caregivers charged with their care. There are a variety of topical pain relievers available commercially to ease the sting of teething, but parents concerned about the safety of rubbing chemical compounds on their baby's sensitive gums are often hesitant to use these over-the-counter medications. Fortunately, there is an effective, all-natural alternative treatment for the side effects that accompany teething. Baltic amber teething jewelry has been used by parents for centuries to reduce the discomfort and salivation caused by the surfacing of new teeth, and has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in recent years. In order to make sure that your baby's Baltic amber teething necklace performs as effectively as possible, there are several points you should keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>1. Amber Teething Necklace Isn't Real 'Teething' Necklace.</strong><br/> This is common misunderstanding among moms. Despite term 'teething necklace" it's not made for chewing. Baltic amber does reduce the discomfort caused by teething, but necklaces made from it shouldn't be chewed. While traditional teething rings may help your child satisfy the urge to chew in order to help new teeth surface, amber teething necklaces work by releasing a compound, succinic acid, that helps to alleviate teething symptoms when it's absorbed through the skin.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Maintain Direct Contact With Baby's Skin.</strong><br/> Because the succinic acid released by amber must be absorbed through the skin in order to be effective, it's important to maintain contact between the necklace and your baby's skin. Always tuck the necklace under the collar of shirts or onesies so that the healing properties are fully realized. Though your baby's new teething necklace is beautiful, it won't be as effective if it's worn on the outside of clothing.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Remove Amber Teething Necklace Before Bed.</strong><br/> Always remove amber teething jewelry before placing a baby down for a nap or putting them to sleep for the night. An amber teething necklace should be removed from the child when your baby will be under no supervision for long periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>4. Remove While Bathing or Swimming.</strong><br/> Amber is vulnerable to soaps, shampoos, body lotions, sunscreens. The chemicals in these products&nbsp; can damage amber. Avoid using amber teething jewelry together with above products.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cleaning Amber Teething Jewelry.</strong><br/> Never use any chemical cleaning liquid except water for cleaning your amber teething jewelry. Never soak the beads in water. Instead, use lukewarm water with a soft cloth, such as felt, or a very soft toothbrush to clean between the beads. A tiny bit of olive oil can be used to polish the stones and then give them a final rubdown with a soft clean cloth to make them shine.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Storing Amber Teething Jewelry.</strong><br/> When amber teething jewelry is not being worn it should be stored away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures of either hot or cold should be avoided. A soft fabric drawstring bag is perfect for keeping the amber safe and protected.</p>
<p>The soothing properties of Baltic amber have been scientifically researched by Robert Koch, a Nobel prize recipient and celebrated scientist. His studies indicated that succinic acid is, in fact, an effective remedy for teething discomfort. That study also indicated that succinic acid does not build up within the body to dangerous levels, making amber teething jewelry a very safe, all-natural alternative to chemically-created topical analgesics. By following these steps, you can keep both your child and your amber teething jewelry perfectly safe.</p>
