<p>The drooling, pain and frustration of teething can be a test for babies, as well as the parents and caregivers charged with their care. There are a variety of topical pain relievers available commercially to ease the sting of teething, but parents concerned about the safety of rubbing chemical compounds on their baby's sensitive gums are often hesitant to use these over-the-counter medications. Fortunately, there is an effective, all-natural alternative treatment for the side effects that accompany teething. Baltic amber teething jewelry has been used by parents for centuries to reduce the discomfort and salivation caused by the surfacing of new teeth, and has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in recent years. In order to make sure that your baby's Baltic amber teething necklace performs as effectively as possible, there are several points you should keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>1. Amber Teething Necklace Isn't Real 'Teething' Necklace.</strong><br/> This is common misunderstanding among moms. Despite term 'teething necklace" it's not made for chewing. Baltic amber does reduce the discomfort caused by teething, but necklaces made from it shouldn't be chewed. While traditional teething rings may help your child satisfy the urge to chew in order to help new teeth surface, amber teething necklaces work by releasing a compound, succinic acid, that helps to alleviate teething symptoms when it's absorbed through the skin.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Maintain Direct Contact With Baby's Skin.</strong><br/> Because the succinic acid released by amber must be absorbed through the skin in order to be effective, it's important to maintain contact between the necklace and your baby's skin. Always tuck the necklace under the collar of shirts or onesies so that the healing properties are fully realized. Though your baby's new teething necklace is beautiful, it won't be as effective if it's worn on the outside of clothing.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Remove Amber Teething Necklace Before Bed.</strong><br/> Always remove amber teething jewelry before placing a baby down for a nap or putting them to sleep for the night. An amber teething necklace should be removed from the child when your baby will be under no supervision for long periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>4. Remove While Bathing or Swimming.</strong><br/> Amber is vulnerable to soaps, shampoos, body lotions, sunscreens. The chemicals in these products&nbsp; can damage amber. Avoid using amber teething jewelry together with above products.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cleaning Amber Teething Jewelry.</strong><br/> Never use any chemical cleaning liquid except water for cleaning your amber teething jewelry. Never soak the beads in water. Instead, use lukewarm water with a soft cloth, such as felt, or a very soft toothbrush to clean between the beads. A tiny bit of olive oil can be used to polish the stones and then give them a final rubdown with a soft clean cloth to make them shine.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Storing Amber Teething Jewelry.</strong><br/> When amber teething jewelry is not being worn it should be stored away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures of either hot or cold should be avoided. A soft fabric drawstring bag is perfect for keeping the amber safe and protected.</p>
<p>The soothing properties of Baltic amber have been scientifically researched by Robert Koch, a Nobel prize recipient and celebrated scientist. His studies indicated that succinic acid is, in fact, an effective remedy for teething discomfort. That study also indicated that succinic acid does not build up within the body to dangerous levels, making amber teething jewelry a very safe, all-natural alternative to chemically-created topical analgesics. By following these steps, you can keep both your child and your amber teething jewelry perfectly safe.</p>
