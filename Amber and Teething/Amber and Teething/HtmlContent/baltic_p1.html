<div class="content" >
<p>While many may look at amber as just a beautiful adornment, the medicinal properties of amber have been used for over two millennia.  In cultures all over the world, there are historical records praising amber in healing, from soothing teething babies to fighting infections. It was not until the last few centuries that technology has progressed enough for medical researchers to isolate the compounds and properties such as succinic acid that amber contains that verify the medical benefits of this wondrous gemstone.</p>
<p><strong>History of Amber in Medicine</strong><br>
There are records of the use of amber dating into antiquity, both in written records and archeological finds. Hippocrates, often referred to as the “father of medicine” wrote about the medical properties of amber as far back as 400 B.C. There are many examples of amber being used during Roman times as well, both taken internally for ailments as well as wearing amulets to prevent and reduce disease. There continues to be historic records and even mono-graphic papers written by doctors on the uses of amber in medicine, all the way through the middle ages up to modern time. Some of the uses of amber that have been recorded include:
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the 1500′s, Nicolaus Copernicus wrote a medicinal formula that included the ingredient amber.</li>
		<li>A well known physician in Roman times, Calistratus recorded that amber in powdered form mixed with honey could remedy eye, ear and throat diseases.</li>
		<li>During the black plague, amber was burned for fumigation. It was recorded that no ambermen in certain cities ever died from the plague.</li>
		<li>As early as the 1500′s, succinic acid was being isolated and extracted from amber to use in medicine.</li>
		<li>In the Middle Ages, amber oils and extracts were used to treat a variety of illnesses, including jaundice, wounds and to strengthen the body.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>In addition to the many medicinal uses, amber was also used in religion as well. After Christianity was established, amber was burned as incense as a air purifier. It was thought to cleanse the churches and help patrons concentrate while worshiping.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Uses Of Amber And Succinic Acid</strong><br>
When a substance like amber has been used for thousands of years for medical uses, modern medicine must investigate and examine the properties to discover what components may have medicinal uses. Nobel Prize winner Robert Kock analyzed succinic acid in the late 1800′s to determine whether it was in fact beneficial and also to ensure that it was not toxic. He concluded that there were positive properties to the acid and that there was no toxicity in humans, even when taken in large quantities.
</p>
<p>
Many modern studies have confirmed the use of succinic acid for a variety of uses. Some of the research published at the National Library of Medicine shows positive results for using succinic acid in the treatment of:
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Inhibition of lipid peroxidation in the brain</li>
		<li>Possible positive effects on life span extension</li>
		<li>Positive results using succinic acid to protect and repair the cardio system and heart</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
Succinic acid is considered to be an anti-oxidant that protects the cells from free radicals, which can boost the immune system, protect the heart and stimulate neural system recovery. It has also been studied in reducing the size of tumors and in cancer research. The medicinal uses of this amber component are only just being uncovered by modern science.
</p>

<p><strong>Use Of Amber In Chinese Medicine</strong><br>
The Chinese have used amber or succinum in their medicines for centuries and continue to do so today.  In the Materia Medica, this component is listed as a sedative, although it is used for other ailments as well. Some of the modern uses for succinum in Chinese medicine include:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Calming agent. Succinum is used for epilepsy, insomnia and palpitations, to calm the body.</li>
		<li>Urinary agent. The Chinese use succinum to alleviate water retention and relieving problems urinating.</li>
		<li>Reproductive agent. Succinum is also used to treat menstrual issues and prostate problems.</li>
		<li>Heart and blood conditions. Conditions such as clogged arteries, strokes and angina as well as heart attacks are treated with succinum.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
Amber is more than just a pretty gem to hang from a necklace or earring. This amazing gem has medicinal properties that have been recognized and used for thousands of years and still are used today.
