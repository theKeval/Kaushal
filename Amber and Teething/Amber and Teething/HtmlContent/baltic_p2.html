<h1>Relatives of Baltic Amber </h1>

<p>
Natural Baltic amber is thought by many to be the true amber and is sought after, especially for the use in jewelry. However, although approximately 90% of the amber sold today is from the Baltic region, there are many relatives of this popular source that also have their own unique attributes. Dominican, Italian, Burmese and other relatives of Baltic amber are found all over the world, along with copal, which often confused with amber, yet very different. To understand the difference between these other 200 types and Baltic amber, it is important to understand the differences in origin, age and color.
</p>
<p><strong>Attributes Of Baltic And Dominican Amber</strong><br>
Baltic is by far the most popular type of amber as well as the most abundant. The second most prevalent and produces the majority of the other 10% of amber sold is Dominican. These two regions produce the majority of all amber on the market. Although similar, the two are different in a few distinct ways.
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Baltic amber. For centuries, amber referred specifically to the Baltic amber or also called succinite, formed from the pine resin of the region, the Pinus succinifera. Samples of the clear form of Baltic amber ranges in color from a yellowish lemon to a dark cherry color. It can also be opaque, from a butterscotch color to almost white. Succinite is found primarily in northern Europe, created from conifer resin that existed 35-50 million years ago. Baltic amber contains between 3-8% of succinic acid, identifying as the true amber from the region.</li>
		<li>Dominican amber.  Dominican amber has a few distinctions from Baltic amber. The majority of Dominican amber is clear, about 90%. It is found in the Northern and Eastern mountain ranges of the Dominican Republic, in clay and sand stones and is younger than Baltic, about 25 million years old. The resin is from the Hymenaea tree and the colors range from yellow, green and red to even blue. Many pieces contain fossilized insects, which are much more rare in Baltic amber.</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<p><strong>Other Common Types Of Amber</strong><br>
Although Baltic and Dominican are by far the most prevalent amber sources, there are hundreds of other types from many different regions and plants. Each is unique due to the region in which it was produced, the elements it was exposed to, the age and the type of resin they were made from. Some of the more common types that are related to Baltic amber include:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Italian amber. Found in southern Italy or Sicily along the banks of the Simetus river, Italian amber was created in the early Miocene period, which was 22-25 million years ago. The plant resin origin is unknown. This amber is rare, black in color in its raw form. The stone can become a dark red when polished.</li>
		<li>Mexican amber. Mexican or Chiapas amber is found in the lignite layers in the Lacondon jungle, dating back to the early Miocene period, around 20-23 million years ago. The resin source, like the Dominican amber, is the Hymenaea tree. These stones range from yellow to a reddish brown, although some pieces can be blue or translucent red.</li>
		<li>Burmese amber. Burmese amber, also called Burmite is found in North Burma in the Hukong Valley clay deposits. This amber is sourced from the Agathis (Araucariaceae) plant and is from the early Cretaceous period, about 100 million years ago. Burmite is often clean or translucent, ranging from red to brown and often containing well-preserved fossils.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Differences Between Amber And Copal</strong><br>
Many people who are unfamiliar with amber origins may think that copal, since it is also formed from resin is the same as amber. However, both the regions that it is formed in and the age are much different. Although to the untrained eye, copal may look like a yellow or brown amber, it does not have the same composition. In fact, many copals are soluble, making them much different than amber. Most copals are formed in tropical regions in delta areas and may be as little as only a few decades old. For example:
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Columbian copal. One of the older forms of copal is the Columbian variety. These are usually between a few hundred years to 5,000 years old and are a pale yellow in color.</li>
		<li>Madagascar copal. Found on the western coast area, Madagascar copal is between 60-500 years in age and found only a few feet under the surface. It is also usually a yellowish color or brown.</li>
		<li>East Africa copal. Copal from the Zanzibar area in East Africa originates from the Trachylobium verrucasum and can be as little as 50 and up to 2 million years old. These pieces are usually pale yellow to brown, often very clear.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Although all these pieces may look similar, there is a large difference in when, where and how amber and copal is formed. Each type has its own history that adds to the value and beauty of the piece.
