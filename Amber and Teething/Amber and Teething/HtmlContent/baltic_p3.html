<h1>Chemical Composition and Morphology of Baltic amber </h1>
<img src="img/chemical_composition.jpg" />
<div class="content" >
<p><strong>Chemical Composition</strong><br>
Amber is a high molecular compound of organic acids that contains, on average, 79% carbon, 10.5% hydrogen, and 10.5% oxygen. Its formula is С10Н16О4. In 100 grams of amber, there are 81 grams of carbon, 7.3 grams of hydrogen, 6.34 grams of oxygen as well as small amounts of sulfur, nitrogen and mineral substances. Quantitative ratios between separate elements in amber are subject to fluctuations. They are impermanent, not only for a single deposit of amber or manifestations, but even for one piece of amber. The impermanence of its composition does not allow amber to be classified as a mineral. The term “amber” should be considered as a collective for a number of fossil resins. A typical representative of this series is succinite. It is usually identified as high quality amber.

		Morphology of amber pieces
	</strong>
	</br>
	The morphology of amber pieces is considered an important factor; it is valuable in two aspects.First of all, a major part of jewelry is produced with regard to the natural shape of its pieces.Secondly, studying the shape of amber pieces, it is possible to restore the conditions in which there was a flow from the coniferous soft resin that has ultimately transformed into amber.
The main shapes of amber pieces are drops, stalactites, and drop-like streams or “amber icicles” on and in the tree trunk.
</p>
<p><strong>Drops </strong>
 of amber in Baltic deposits occur quite often. It is clearly distinguished, very similar to spherical, including the main body of a drop and a “neck.” The larger the drop is, the more distinct it becomes. The majority of drops in their original state have had to hang down freely from the tree branches.Those drops that touched the tree branches have their marks on the surface, like a light dent or a shallow groove. All drops are continuous, indicating the continuous outflow of the resin from the resin pockets on the tree branches.The ends are slightly dulled on a number of drops; obviously, when falling,the drops were slightly flattened.Generally, the drops are almost symmetrical, which means that the resin pockets were a sufficient distance from each other. It has promoted the free growth of a drop until under its own weight has fallen on the ground.</br>
 The diameter of drops is usually 2.5 centimeters; however, it is known that drops of amber can reach the size of a lemon, or even a goose egg.  Small drops, as a rule, are transparent and translucent; the large drops are only slightly translucent. The surface of the drop is smooth and sometimes slightly cracked as a result of formation of a weathering crust.</br>
 A separate group is made by drops of gray amber with a wrinkled and cracked surface. Some of them have a shape reminiscent of a walnut.

	<strong>
		Stalactites
	</strong>
	of amber are very rare.These are small brownish-yellow streams of amber. The stalactite was formed as a result of a periodic discharge of resin from a tree; the second portion of resin was covering the first one, followed by the third portion. But at the same time, one indispensable condition was met: each next portion of resin was imposed on the layer which hadn’t stiffened yet, i.e. the periods between the discharges of separate resin portions were short-term.The layers that composed stalactite are slightly different in color; however, in cross-section, the concentric structure of a stalactite isn’t clearly expressed. This is due to the unequal thickness of the layers. The length of a stalactite is 2.5 centimeters; it is thicker (1.7 cm) at the bottom than at the end (1 cm).

	<strong>
		Drop-like icicles
	</strong>
	of amber, unlike the amber drops, have a considerable length. They may be up to 5 centimeters in length,with a width that is half that size, or 2.5 centimeters. Icicles have a massive texture; smooth on the surface and sometimes slightly wrinkled due to a brown crust weathering. They are composed with gray-yellow nontransparent amber. A large groove on one of the streams apparently represents the trace from a branch which a sinter has met during its growth. Drop-like icicles were made of a less viscous resin, unlike drops or stalactites. This resin didn’t expand a sinter, but rather flowed down over it; as a consequence the sinter grew in length.

	<strong>
		Amber icicles on a tree trunk 
	</strong>
	are widespread in deposits. They are formed as a result of an intensive resin outflow on the tree trunk, therefore slightly repeating its bend. In a cross section,icicles have a crescent shape. On the concave side of the sinter there are scraps of tree bark and pieces of wood. Streams on the tree trunk are rich with arthropods.</br>
	A characteristic feature of icicles is its conchoidal structure which is well noticeable in the cross section.A sinter consists of layers that lay tightly together; however, unlike a stalactite, these layers are easily separated.They have a rough surface with a plurality of grooves that extend along the sinter. By closely investigating a cross section of icicles, it is possible to imagine the nature of the resin discharge during their formation.Originally the resin was flowing gradually from two adjacent pockets; two small streams of resin are well visible in a cross section of some icicles. Later, two resin pockets were connected in one, in such a mass of resin that it was able to absorb both pockets. As a rule, the layers of the amber that have arisen due to the subsequent resin outflow are lighter than previous layers.This result is due to the bark pieces providing amber with a darker shade get in the initial portions of resin. In all icicles,weathering the crust prevented the layers from sticking together.</br>
	The pieces of the amber on the tree trunk including traces as imprints of bark and vegetable fabric are also noteworthy.The traces left over from the tree bark appear like cracks up to 4.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width. The amber flowing down the trunk and reaching soil is the richest with vegetable remains.There are also the samples of amber overflowed with slices of brown bark and adjoining with large air inclusions(up to 0.3 cm). Such amber is not considered suitable for handmade crafts at all.

	<strong>
		Icicles inside the tree trunk
	</strong>
	as the name implies, were created in the tree trunk. The cavities necessary for filling with the resin could arise at different damages of a trunk, particularly at a hollow formation. Sub crustal damage of a cambium has released a place for the resin between the growth rings of a tree. The resin which has filled it has the appearance of tiles with crescent cross section. The discharges of amber in the tree trunk have a massive texture.Icicles up to 10 cm in length have relatively thick plates(up to 1.5 cm) of transparent, translucent, matte and milky-white amber, with the crescent section and rough edges.Plates-icicles have the impress of cambium fibers, and in some cases have a brown weathering crust.
The amber on the tree trunk is characterized by the greatest size; however, they tend to have a layered structure that limits its application. The amber in the tree trunk is less, but it is massive, which increases its practical value.
